                    Hi, this is Hugo ChunHo Lin, a 4th-year student at
                    <a href="https://www.ncu.edu.tw/" className="code-highlight-yellow">National Central University (NCU)</a>,
                    driven by a <em><strong>genuine passion</strong></em> for the field of <strong>Software Engineering 💻</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am currently preparing my application for a Master's Degree, while simultaneously serving as a
                    <strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tw/education/awseducate/" className="code-highlight-yellow">Amazon
                        Web Services (AWS) Educate</a> Cloud Ambassador -- Tech Support</strong> and an <strong>Ex Software
                            Engineering (SWE)
                            Intern at
                        <a href="https://www.pegatroncorp.com/" className="code-highlight-yellow">Pegatron Corp.</a></strong>, turning complex
                    problems into simple, beautiful and intuitive designs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As part of my preparation,
                    I'm honing my programming skills using the <strong><code className="code-highlight-yellow">GO</code></strong> language for <strong>Web Development, </strong>
                    focusing on <strong>API creation and backend tasks.</strong>
                    Additionally, I'm delving into <strong>automated deployment processes</strong> to grasp
                    fundamental concepts of <strong><code className="code-highlight-yellow">Kubernetes</code> and <code className="code-highlight-yellow">Cloud Dev.</code> workflows.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lastly, I would like to demonstrate my enthusiastic <code className="code-highlight-yellow">Open-Source</code> spirit, as I am eager to share my new knowledge and what I have learned. Thank you all for being here.
