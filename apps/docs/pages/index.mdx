## 📍 Abstract

Inspired by the [codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio](https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio), we aim to convert the `HTML/CSS` template into a [React-based](https://react.dev/) project using [Next.js Turborepo](https://turbo.build/).

Our goal is to provide a template where users can build their own portfolio and blog by simply modifying the **configuration and content** without changing the core code. Users will be able to set up their portfolio by updating the config and adding their own posts to the `contents` folder.

We'll also provide comprehensive documentation, including a user guide, code walkthrough, and thorough test coverage to ensure a smooth experience.

## ✨ Features

- 🚧 Skeleton Loading
- ⚡️ Next.js 14 with App Router
- [🟩 GitHub Calendar Heatmap](https://github.com/grubersjoe/react-github-calendar)
- ✍🏻 Markdown Rendering
- 🧪 Components Unit Testing
