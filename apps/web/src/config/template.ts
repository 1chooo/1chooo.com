    introduction: `
I'm an incoming student at [University of Southern California](https://usc.edu) ‚úåÔ∏è. Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from [National Central University](https://www.ncu.edu.tw/) üêøÔ∏è.

Software is built by humans. Unfortunately, humans make errors, ***LOTS of ERRORS üí£.*** Throughout human history, humans have learned to craft machines and tools to help us construct complex architecture. Inspired by this, I explore practical methodologies and tools to improve large-scale software systems' quality, reliability, and efficiency.

In my spare time, I focus on contributing to open-source projects, alongside working out üí™üèª, capturing street photography üì∏, and writing tech content ‚úçüèª.
