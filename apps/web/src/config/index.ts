    introduction: `
I obtained my Bachelor's degree from [National Central University üêøÔ∏è](https://www.ncu.edu.tw/), driven by a *sincere passion* for **Software Engineering üíª.**

Software is built by humans. Unfortunately, humans make errors, <mark class="text-orange-yellow-crayola bg-transparent"><b>LOTS of ERRORS.</b></mark> Throughout human history, humans have learned to craft machines and tools to help us construct complex architecture. Inspired by this, I explore practical methodologies and tools to improve large-scale software systems' quality, reliability, and efficiency.

In my spare time, I focus on contributing to open-source projects, alongside working out üí™üèª, capturing street photography üì∏, and writing tech content ‚úçüèª.

**Self-motivated, Team player, Love coding üë®üèª‚Äçüíª**
