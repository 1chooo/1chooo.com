Hi everyone! I'm Hugo. I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) a lot for coding and writing. If you're interested in how I write better Markdown in VSCode, check out üëâüèª [Your Life Needs to Be MARKDOWNED: Essential Tips for Exceptional GitHub Writing](https://medium.com/@1chooo/vyour-life-need-to-be-markdowned-essential-tips-for-exceptional-github-writing-08c23ddc3464).

I also use Git to manage my projects. One of my favorite tools was the [Git Graph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph) extension in VSCode. But with the new [VSCode 1.93 update](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_93), Git Graph is now built into VSCode's Source Control (shortcut: Control + Shift + G). This means we no longer need an extra extension to see our Git collaboration graphs. Let's check out this new feature together!

In the past, we had to open Git Graph to see our project's collaboration graph, like this:

However, even in the older [VSCode 1.92 version](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_92), I noticed that VSCode started adding Git Graph into the program itself. At first, you could only see the graph when you were pushing changes. But now, with [VSCode 1.93](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_93), you can see the Git Graph directly in Source Control, like this:

This is super helpful because you don't need an extra tool to check the graph. Now, I can see all the files I've changed and the commits my team has made in one place. If you click on a commit, you can even see what was changed:

I hope this makes your coding life easier! I'll be sharing more tips on how I use VSCode to work better, so stay tuned if you want to learn more!
