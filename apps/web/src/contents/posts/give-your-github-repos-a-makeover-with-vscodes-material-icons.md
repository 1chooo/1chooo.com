Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is Hugo. I am a very addicted and heavy user of GitHub and VSCode. I have spent more than **10 hours** on them. Moreover, I have made more than **5,000 contributions** on GitHub in the past year. Therefore, I often find some cool plugins to enhance my workflow. I found a really cool Chrome pluginâ€”[Material Icons for GitHub]. That can make the file icon on GitHub look like VSCode.

Today, I will show you how to give your GitHub repos a step-by-step makeover with VS Code's Material Icons. Let's dive in.
