Hey there 👋! This is Hugo. My portfolio website-[1chooo.com](https://www.1chooo.com/) has come to [`v0.3`](https://github.com/1chooo/1chooo.com/releases/tag/v0.3.0) version and we finally support render markdown to the blog post. However, sometimes the wrapping of the words may not change as we expected. Today we are going to share a package to let our website more readable.

## Usage

We have to install the package first:

```bash
npm i react-wrap-balancer
```

Then we can use it in our project:

```tsx
import Balancer from "react-wrap-balancer";

// ...

function Title() {
  return (
    <h1>
      <Balancer>My Awesome Title</Balancer>
    </h1>
  );
}
```

If we have multiple `<Balancer>` components used, we can wrap them with `<Provider>` to share the re-balance logic:

```tsx
import { Provider } from "react-wrap-balancer";

// ...

function App() {
  return (
    <Provider>
      <MyApp />
    </Provider>
  );
}
```

## Demo

We can see the difference between using and not using the package (applied to my portfolio website):
