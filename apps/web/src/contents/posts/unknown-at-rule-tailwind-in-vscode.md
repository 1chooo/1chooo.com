Hey there 👋, it's Hugo. Today, I'll walk you through a common issue I encountered while developing my portfolio website—one that you might also face when integrating [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) in a [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) environment. When I added Tailwind to my project, I was greeted by the following error message: `Unknown at rule @tailwind`

## Understanding the Cause

Upon visiting the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup#syntax-support), I found the answer in the **Editor Setup** section. The documentation explains that Tailwind CSS relies on several custom CSS at-rules, including `@tailwind`, `@apply`, and `@config`. Unfortunately, many code editors don't recognize these rules by default, which can lead to warning or error messages.

> "Tailwind CSS uses a lot of custom CSS at-rules like `@tailwind`, `@apply`, and `@config`, and in many editors this can trigger warnings or errors where these rules aren't recognized."

To solve this, we need to make VSCode aware that these are valid Tailwind-specific rules.

## Solution: Install PostCSS Language Support

To address this, simply install the [`PostCSS Language Support`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=csstools.postcss) extension for VSCode, which adds syntax support for Tailwind's custom rules.

### How to Install PostCSS Language Support

1. Open the extension marketplace in VSCode.

   - **Shortcut**: Press `Ctrl/Command + Shift + X`.
   - **Manual Navigation**: Click the Extensions icon on the left toolbar.

2. In the marketplace, search for "PostCSS Language Support."

3. Install the extension.

Once installed, you should see that the `@tailwind` rule is no longer flagged as an error, and any previous warning messages disappear.

After above steps, you should no longer see the "Unknown at rule @tailwind" message in your VSCode editor. This simple solution will help you work more efficiently with Tailwind CSS in your projects.
